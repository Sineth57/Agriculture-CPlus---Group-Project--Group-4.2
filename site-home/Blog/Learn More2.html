				<h3>Major Soil Types in Sri Lanka</h3>
				
				<p>Major Soil Types available in Sri Lanka are Reddish Brown Earth Soil, 
					Non-calcic Brown Soil, Red-Yellow Podzolic Soil, Reddish Brown Lateritic 
					Soil, Red-Yellow Latosols, Immature Brown Loamy Soil, Rendzina Soil, 
					Grumosols Soil, Solodized Solonetz Soil, Low-Humic Glay Soil, Meadow 
					Podzolic Soil, Alluvial Soil, and Regosols Vidarsha Prathibha.</p>

				<h2>Reddish Brown Earth Soil </h2>
				<p>These soils are reddish to reddish-brown and also
					found in the upper and mid slopes of the landscape i
					n the dry zone. The normal depth is about 1.0 to 1.2 m. 
					and the water holding capacity ranges from 100 to 140 mm/meter depth of soil.
					 The steady infiltration rate ranges from about 1 to 5 cm/hr. The percolation
					  rates of the wet puddled soils for the first time exceed about 100 mm/d and 
					  remains at a higher value of about 10-20 mm/d even after 6 years of continuous 
					  puddling. Then, these soils are reddish to reddish-brown and found in the upper 
					  and mid slopes of the landscape in
				   the dry zone.</p>

				<h2>Old Alluvial Soils </h2>
				<p>These Old Alluvial soils occur in old river terraces and they are imperfectly to poorly drain with high infiltration rates of about 5-40 cm/hr. The water holding capacity is low as 40 to 80
					mm for a meter depth of soil and these soils are low in productivity.

				<h2>Alluvial soils</h2>
				<p>Alluvial soils are reddish to brownish, moderately fine-textured, and imperfectly to poorly drained. The majority of these soils occur in flood plains and these soils are deep. These soils are more suitable for rice cultivation. Crops that can grow in Alluvial Soil are Paddy, Sugarcane, and corn, etc. They are deep and variable in drai
					nage an texture. The structure is variable, ranging from well-developed to weak.</p>

				<h2>Red Yellow Podzolic Soils  </h2>
				<p>Red Yellow Podzolic Soils are the most widely spread great soil groups found in the wet zone. Then, they occur in diverse landforms and are normally deep. Predominant textural classes of surface soils are sandy loam, sandy clay loam or loam and the structure is wea
					k or moderate with a crumb or granular structure.

				<h2>Reddish Brown Latosolic Solis  </h2>
				<p>Reddish Brown Latosolic Soils - Most of these soils occur on terrains that have been incised by ecological erosion and these soils are relatively young. The texture is mostly sandy clay 
					loam soil and the structure is strong crumb to granular under natural vegetation.

				<h2>Immature Brown Loams  </h2>
				<p>mmature Brown Loams - These are young soils occurring in close association with Reddish-brown latosolic soils. 
					Soil texture is predominantly sandy loam or loam soil. The structure is often weak crumb or subangul
    are blocky. Soil reaction is acidic in the wet zone,

				<h3>Climate Conditions in Sri Lanka Geography</h3>
			</div>
		<div class="unit">
			<div class="text">
				
				<p>Tit Lanka is found in the tropical belt of the world. Though, the centr al hills of the 
					country divide Sri Lanka into 3 major climatic zones by acting as a barrier to the m onsoon winds. Then, the three major climatic zones are wet, intermediate, and dry zones which receive an average annual rainfall of more than 5000-2500 mm, 2500-1750 mm, and 1750-900 mm, respectively. Also, three main regions in the island have been identified, based on elevation. Then, they are categorized as the low country (0 - 300 m),
					 mid-country (300 - 900 m), and upcountry about more than 900 m..</p>
				<p>Rain-fed wetland rice cultivation are mainly practiced in the wet zone. Its position between 5 and 10 north latitudes endows 
					the country with year-round warm weather conditions, moderated by ocean winds and considerable moisture. The average temperature levels from a low of about 16°C in Nuwara Eliya in the Central Highlands where frost can occur for several days in the winter season to a high of about 32°C in Trincomalee on the northeast coast (where temperatures may reach 38°C). The average yearly temperature level for Sri Lanka as a whole ranges from 28 to 30°C. Day and night temperatures change by 4 to 7 C. January is the coolest m onth mainly in the highlands,
					where overnight temperatures may fall to 5 C</p>

				<p> Sri Lanka's agriculture is mainly categorized by a non-plantation sector and a plantation sector. Of the country's 2.3 million hectares of agriculural land, 80% is used for non-plantation food crops, comprising rice, maize, fruits, vegetables, and other crops.
					Agriculture has been an important driver of poverty reduction and also accounted for about one-third of the decline in poverty over the past decade.

				<h3>Major Crops Cultivated in Sri Lanka</h3>
			</div>
		<div class="unit">
			<div class="text">
				
				<p>The agriculture sector in Sri Lanka always acts as a main economic strength to the national economy. It involves crop cultivations such as Paddy, Tea, Rubber, Coconut, vegetables, fruits, export crops, and sugar while also livestock and fisheries sectors provide a substantial contribution simultaneously
					.</p>

							<p>Oilseed crops cultivated in Sri Lanka are groundnut, sesame, sunflower, and mustard.
					Groundnut is grown mainly in Moneragala, Anuradhapura, Hambantota, Kurunegala, Ratnapura and Puttalam districts in Sri Lanka. Some food crops cultivated in Sri Lanka include yams, pulses, grains, vegetables, and fruits. Sugar cane is cultivated in the dry
					zone.
					Major spices found in Sri Lanka are Curry Leaves, Turmeric, Clove, Cinnamon, Pepper, Cardamom, Lemongrass and Citronella, Nutmeg and Mace, and Ginger.</p>

				<h3>Fruits and Vegetables Grown in Sri Lanka </h3>
			</div>
		<div class="unit">
			<div class="text">
				
				<p>The well-demarcated low country and dry wet areas are suitable for a different
					variety of tropical fruits and vegetables ranging from Green Chilli, Red Onion, 
					Pumpkin, Bitter Gourd, Melon, Sour, and Sweet Banana Types, Queen Pineapple, Papaya, 
					Mango, Lemon, and Gherkins. 90% of the fresh product is targeted to the Middle East a
					nd the Maldives and almost about 75% of the processed products go to the European market.
					 Sri Lanka is looking to get arid-climate-resistant fruit species from Egypt to develop agriculture in the dry zones. </p>
				<p>Then, they collectively produce more than 9,00,000 metric tons of fruit and vegetable annually and export both fresh and processed varieties to many destinations in the world.
					The cooler climes of the central hill regions are excellent for temperate crops like C
					arrot, Leek, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Salad Leaves, Beet, Bean, Bell Pepper, and Salad Cucumbers, and other fruits and vegetables. Sri Lanka also produces tropical fruit such as Pineapple.
					Mangos, Avocado, Rambutan, Star Fruit, and Passion Fruit, etc. Also, they are known to contain Slenty of nutrients and entail significant health benefits.</p>

				<p> Sri Lanka also exports various endogenous yams, underwater stems, and fruit and pods of perennial crops such as Bread Fruit, Young Jackfruit, and Drumstick which are local and international favorites. The fruits and vegetables exports are a result of the efforts of semi-commercialized small farmers whose individual extent of land does not exceed a
					hectare.</p>
